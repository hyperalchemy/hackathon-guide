### About ETHPrague

ETHPrague is a hybrid event that combines a conference and a hackathon, with an additional track of talks and technical workshops designed to inspire and support the hackers.&#x20;

Throughout the entire weekend, you will have access to a dedicated space where you can work on your project, take breaks, and relax. This way, you can focus solely on bringing your ideas to life.

The capacity of the hackathon will be approximately **500 hackers**.&#x20;

We encourage projects that address **sustainability**, **local economies**, **urban issues**, and any other ideas that contribute to a way leading to a **Solarpunk** utopia.

<mark style="color:blue;">The exact tracks will be announced few weeks before the hackathon.</mark>



The hackathon will take place in an offline form in order to ensure the best possible networking and cooperation. However, we do not rule out remote participation if at least one team member is present on site.&#x20;

Only confirmed hackers who can participate to the hackathon. Please review hackathon rules [here](hackers-manual/hackathon-rules.md).



Voting on the quality of individual projects will not only be up to dedicated judges, but will also be decided by the hackathon participants themselves through quadratic voting.

<mark style="color:blue;">More details including rules and bounties will be announced in the coming weeks</mark>



ETHPrague Hackathon is organized by [Institute of Cryptoanarchy](https://www.paralelnipolis.cz/en/o-nas/) and [Ducktape Production](https://ducttape.events/)
