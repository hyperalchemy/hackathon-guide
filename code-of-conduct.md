# ðŸ’– Code of conduct

Our solarpunk hackathon is an inclusive, welcoming, and safe community. We do not tolerate any harmful or discriminatory behavior from anyone involved in our community, including volunteers, organizers, project leads, contributors, and hackers.

We welcome all individuals, especially those who are new to the community. We foster openness and encourage curiosity. We encourage diversity and leave egos at the door.

Our goal is to create a pleasant environment where all participants can share ideas, learn from each other, and have fun. We believe that by fostering a supportive and inclusive community, we can achieve great things together.&#x20;

We respect others' work, time, and perspectives. Banter and memeing are encouraged as long as they are not harmful or discriminatory. Insulting or trolling is not allowed.&#x20;

Unacceptable behavior and harassment are not tolerated. This includes intimidation, abuse, discrimination, derogatory or demeaning words or actions, inappropriate use of nudity or sexual images, and unwelcome sexual attention.

If you witness or experience unacceptable behavior or have any concerns, please notify a project lead, event organizer, or a member of the core group. We will do everything possible to support and help you. If you cannot find anyone in person, please reach out via email: contact@ethprague.com
