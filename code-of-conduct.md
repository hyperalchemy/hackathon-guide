# ðŸ“œ Code of conduct

* Our solarpunk hackathon is an inclusive, welcoming, and safe space. We do not tolerate any harmful or discriminatory behavior towards anyone in the community, including volunteers, organizers, project leads, contributors, mentors, and hackers.
* We do not tolerate discrimination or any form of harassment, including but not limited to intimidation, abuse, discrimination against racial, religious, or other beliefs, derogatory or demeaning words or actions, inappropriate use of nudity or sexual images.
* We welcome all individuals, especially those who are new to the space. We foster openness and encourage curiosity, and diversity.
* We respect the work, time, and privacy of others. While we encourage a friendly and informal atmosphere, all communication must remain non-discriminatory and free from harmful or insulting language.
* Please refrain from sharing the contact information of mentors, organizers, speakers, etc., and from reaching out to them with unsolicited requests or unrelated matters. Violating this rule may result in disqualification from the hackathon and being banned from the event. Thank you for your cooperation in respecting the privacy of event contributors.
* Our goal is to create a pleasant environment where all participants can share ideas, learn from each other, and have fun. We believe that by fostering a supportive and inclusive community, we can achieve great things together.

If you witness or experience any unacceptable behavior or have any concerns, please notify an event organizer as soon as possible. We will do everything possible to support and help you.
