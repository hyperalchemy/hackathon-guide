# âš– Hackathon Rules

These are the hackathon rules, please respect them without exception.

* Maximum of 5 people per team.
* All code for projects must be written during the event.
* You cannot use or steal another team's source code.
* Only projects submitted by teams of accepted hackers may compete for the prizes.
* The judges' decision is final in determining the winning projects for prizes and awards.
* Please comply with any other rules and additional instructions from ETHPrague organizers.
* Please respect our [Code of Conduct](https://www.notion.so/o/NNePclmRCTCGh9eRaBcj/s/MHoc6lgEAFfdHJ1GWAca/\~/changes/84/code-of-conduct)!

The hackathon will take place offline to ensure the best possible hacking experience, networking, and cooperation. However, remote participation is also possible.

Having remote team members is okay as long as they are all accepted hackers, and at least one team member is present at the venue to present the project to the judges. However, we strongly recommend that the majority of the team be present at the hackathon, as this also increases your chances of performing well during the presentation.

### Minimum requirements to be judged

* Project must be submitted via Devfolio - Read [submissions.md](submissions.md "mention")
* A link to the open-source code must be provided
* A short description / presentation must describe your project
* If applicable, the contract address(es) of your deployed demo must be provided, either on a testnet of your choice or mainnet of a platform of choice.
