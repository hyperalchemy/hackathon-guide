## Hacker House - VNITROBLOCK

This year, we have a separate Hacker House available just one block (80m) away from Paraleln칤 Polis. This pretty awesome building with great inside garden vibes will provide ample space for productive work and focus for hacking, while also allowing for convenient access to the main conferences.

**Address:** 32 D캩lnick치, 170 00 Praha 7-Hole코ovice [https://goo.gl/maps/5TWmcYYGZbgTxp526](https://goo.gl/maps/5TWmcYYGZbgTxp526)

Please note that we can use the **north entrance**, as displayed on the map below.

**Rest and sleep**

There will be room for resting and relaxing at the hacker house, but we still recommend having accommodations booked. There are many affordable options in Prague, and we also have some listed on the website's Sleep & Rest section. Additionally, you can coordinate with fellow hackers in the Telegram group to share accommodations.
