# ðŸ«‚ Finding a Team

If youâ€™re looking for team-mates or ideas for projects, weâ€™ve got you covered. You can start by writing into the hackathon [telegram chat](https://t.me/+2bPk0y1790JkMTE0) and Introduce yourself, discuss ideas, see what others are up to.

There will also be a **Team-building session**, which will take place after the opening ceremony. No need to prepare anything, just show up. This session will be followed by a short **Brainstorm**, that you can also attend to get at least one solid project idea.

Then youâ€™ll have everything to start your weekend of hacking!
