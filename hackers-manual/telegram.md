# ðŸ’¬ Telegram

We have a private group on Telegram for confirmed hackers, mentors and other hackathon participants. This is the main communication channel within the hackathon, where you can ask any question about the hackathon or your project ([Mentoring](mentors/)).

**Each confirmed hacker received an invitation to the group via email** along with the voucher to redeem their ticket (mandatory to access the venue).&#x20;

If you are a confirmed hacker and are not in the group please contact Ceci - [@hyperalchemy](https://t.me/hyperalchemy) / [ceci@ethprague.com](mailto:ceci@ethprague.com)
