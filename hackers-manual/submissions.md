### **Create a profile in Devfolio** <a href="#create-profile" id="create-profile"></a>

:information\_source: Whether you submit the project(s) Solo or as a Team, you must create a profile for yourself.

1. Go to [**hackathon.ethprague.com**](http://hackathon.ethprague.com)
2. Click on **Apply to Hack**&#x20;
   1. Verify your email (please use the same email address you used in your hacker application)
   2. Click on **Submit Application**

At this point your profile is created and you are in the ETHPrague hackathon dashboard.

### Create a team

You can choose to **Submit Solo** or **Submit as a Team**.

If you submit as a team, one member needs to create the team, and the others can simply add the team code to their dashboard.

1. Click on **Submit in Team**
2. One person per team will:
   1. Insert a team name and click **Create Team**
   2. Pass the generated code to your team members
3. The rest of the team members:
   1. Add the code into team code
   2. Click on **Join Team**
4. One person per team can click on **Add Project**

### Add Your Project

You will be able to update them until submission, and no one will judge your project based on the early information you entered here. You can even simply enter TBD.
