#### Solarpunk Awards

To be eligible for a specific award, the team must choose that award during the project submission process.

Only selected projects will have a 3min pitch in front of the judges.

Judges will then proceed with the voting using their ETHPrague Soulbound token received upon registration.

Overall criteria:

1. Solarpunk Theme: Does the project align with the solarpunk theme?
2. Innovation: How does the project demonstrate innovation?
3. Added Value: What actual added value does the project provide to its users?
4. Technical: How well is the project executed from a technical standpoint?
5. Completeness: Is the project comprehensive and well explained?



**Hackers & Audience Favourite Awards**

These awards will be judged by everyone attending using their ETHPrague Soulbound token received upon registration.



**Sponsor bounties**

Each bounty sponsor reserves the right to specify their own judging criteria.&#x20;
