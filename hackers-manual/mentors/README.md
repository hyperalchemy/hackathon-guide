# üßëüè´ Mentors

During the hackathon, mentors from different fields will be there to assist you with your projects. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact them at any time - they will be available from the start of the hackathon until the closing of project applications.

They will generally be hanging around a **Mentor Base**\*, where you can come find them in person. You can also reach them on the [Telegram group](https://t.me/+2bPk0y1790JkMTE0).

It‚Äôs always better to ask for advice sooner rather than later, you will learn and build quicker that way. Not just code, but also ideas, concepts, design and presentation.

All mentors are listed below, including their telegram account through which you will be able to contact them.

If you don't know who to contact specifically, or have a general question - you can always use our [Telegram group for hackers](https://t.me/+2bPk0y1790JkMTE0).
