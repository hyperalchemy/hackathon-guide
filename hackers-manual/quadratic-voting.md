# ðŸ—³ Quadratic Voting

Upon on-site registration, each hackathon and conference attendee will receive a card with a one-time QR code to mint their unique ETHPrague Soulbound Token (SBT).

Possession of this token will allow attendees and hackers to vote for their favorite project through quadratic voting.

#### How to vote

1. **Mint** your SBT: [http://mint.ethprague.com/](http://mint.ethprague.com/)
2. **Vote** for your favorite project: [http://vote.ethprague.com/](http://vote.ethprague.com/)



Quadratic voting will be made possible through a collaboration with [FactoryDAO](https://www.factorydao.xyz/).
