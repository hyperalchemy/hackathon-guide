# ðŸ—³ Quadratic Voting

Upon on-site registration, each hackathon and conference attendee will receive a card with a one-time QR code to mint their unique ETHPrague Soulbound Token (SBT).

Possession of this token will allow attendees and hackers to vote for their favorite project through quadratic voting.

Quadratic voting will be made possible through a collaboration with [FactoryDAO](https://www.factorydao.xyz/).
